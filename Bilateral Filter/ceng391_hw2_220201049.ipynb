I noticed that sigma_value_s does not make the image huge different. May be because of 7x7 size. Because every distance from pixels is fixed and not many chocies because of this is not to lose details in the edges and roof-top side line. In the other hand in \"gaus_list\" we have more value to implement and many options \n",
